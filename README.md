# Telecom-Pricing

# Telecom Dynamic Pricing

## Overview

This project aims to develop a dynamic pricing model for telecom services using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict customer usage and optimize pricing strategies based on historical data. The project leverages various regression algorithms to analyze customer behavior and provide competitive pricing recommendations.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom_dynamic_pricing.git
   cd telecom_dynamic_pricing

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the data preprocessing scripts and train the models, use the following commands:

Preprocess the data:

python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the models:

python src/train_models.py
Evaluate the models:

python tests/test_data_preprocessing.py
Models
This project implements several regression models to predict pricing, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
Each model's performance is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine the best approach for dynamic pricing.
